# HCI_Project
# I went ahead and got us started on the project, I followed a tutorial on youtube to set up the API, so that part is good.
# Like I said in the groupchat I went to the professor and he gave me some code for the spotify API
# When you guys start pushing code remember to ignore files with your API key (for saftey)
# Your project should have a .gitignore file, where you can ignore file types or files
# You add this to that file  
# Ignore all `.json` files (this is just a comment for the file)
# (*.json) ---> You don't have to ignore all .json files, you can simply put the same of the file --> (*my_api_key.json)
